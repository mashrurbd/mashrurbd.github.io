      <p>
          You should be aware that there are certain things that
          FireBolt! Incorporated will not take responsibility for. Certain
          functions of the app will require the app to have an active
          internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided
          by your mobile network provider, but FireBolt! Incorporated
          cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
          functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
          have any of your data allowance left.
      </p>
      <br/>

      <p>
          With respect to FireBolt! Incorporated’s responsibility for your
          use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to
          bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is
          updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
          to provide information to us so that we can make it available
          to you. FireBolt! Incorporated accepts no liability for any
          loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
          relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
      </p>
      <br/>

      <p>
          At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
          currently available on Android – the requirements for the
          system(and for any additional systems we
          decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
          and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
          using the app. FireBolt! Incorporated does not promise that it
          will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
          and/or works with the Android version that you have
          installed on your device. However, you promise to always
          accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
          also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
          it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
          Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
          rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
          (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it
          from your device.
